Hey, I'm Aliyah Geer. I'm from the Philly area and I'm currently a senior at Cornell majoring in Operations Research and Information Engineering. I'm also working on my 
Masters of Engineering also at Cornell, with a concentration in Data Analytics. I love to longboard, listen to my vinyl record collection, and watch psych thrillers! I'm hoping to one day enter the workforce as a data scientist, with my interests primarily lying in natural language processing.
