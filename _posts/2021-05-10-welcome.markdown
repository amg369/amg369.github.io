Hi, my name is Aliyah Geer. I'm originally from suburban Philadelphia and I'm a current Masters student at Cornell University working on my Masters of Engineering with a concentration in Data Analytics. My professional interests lie largely in cool things that we can do with data: statistical learning, natural language processing, and at the moment I'm especially curious about data infrastructure. Outside of work, I am an avid longboarder, hiker, and music enthusiast.
