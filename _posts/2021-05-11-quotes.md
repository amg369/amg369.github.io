Here are some quotes from popular reviewers that have met Aliyah:

"**Wow!** Aliyah's comedic ability is impeccable! 10/10 stars, highly recommend you meet Aliyah!" - Roger Ebert, May 1999
"Who knew someone so humble could be so... flawless?! It defies logic. 4/5 stars." - The New York Times
"I once heard a story about how one day Aliyah was walking down the street. She was approached by a wild dog, it barking wildly, foaming at the mouth. In response, she simply locked eyes with the rabid animal. After a moment, it stopped its drooling and growling, and bowed its head. She smiled, and patted its head. I will never forget that moment." - Brian Williams, 2014
