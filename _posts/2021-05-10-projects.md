 Here are some projects I've done in the past:
 
[ORIE 4741 Predicting a Song's Mood](https://github.com/amg369/ORIE_4741_Project)

Currently, I'm working on my Masters of Engineering project, **Revamping Recruiting with Data Analytics**, with Booz Allen Hamilton. My team and I have built a model to optimize the client's examination process for so-called "Positions of Trust".
